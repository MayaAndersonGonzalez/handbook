# Our workstyle

We are open - we share our work as widely as possible.

We share our work at 50%, to get input early, not just when it is done.

We are a remote organization, and work asynchronously where possible, synchronous where necessary.

We promise what we can deliver, and we deliver what we promise.

If plans change, we communicate it with the people involved.


We use inclusive language.
