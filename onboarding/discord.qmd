## Summary

Discord is where we gather our ResearchEquals community of practice. You can [join the Discord server]([![Discord online](https://img.shields.io/discord/933331539276759070?label=discord&style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/SefsGJWWSw)) and take part in the (voice) chat, activities, and sharing that takes place there.

## What is Discord?

Discord is an asynchronous communication channel. It is very similar to Slack, if you are familiar.

Discord consists of many servers. Each server is a community of its own. The ResearchEquals server is separate from other servers.

In each server, there are channels. Most of these are text channels, where you can chat with others. There are also audio channels, where you can have conversation.

## Why Discord?

We primarily use Discord because it has...

* ...great audio connectivity (almost like you're on the phone!)
* ...reduces Zoom fatigue (video off by default)
* ...allows us to invite many people without limitations (costs are not per user, but for added features)
* ...great moderation features

## Getting started

- [ ] [Create a Discord account](https://discord.com/register)

## Getting help

We're a pretty friendly bunch in there. If you need any assistance, ask in `#help`. No matter whether it's debugging your audio or how to create your own Discord server - somebody will help you out!

In the case of somebody being a pain, tag `@mods` and we will check it out. We do not tolerate any direct or indirect hate speech (see also our [Code of Conduct](https://researchequals.com/coc)).
