    "text": "Goals\nThe overarching goal of Quarto is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better. We hope to do this in several dimensions:\n\nCreate a writing and publishing environment with great integrated tools for technical content. We want to make authoring with embedded code, equations, figures, complex diagrams, interactive widgets, citations, cross references, and the myriad other special requirements of scientific discourse straightforward and productive for everyone.\nHelp authors take full advantage of the web as a connected, interactive platform for communications, while still providing the ability to create excellent printed output from the same document source. Researchers shouldn‚Äôt need to choose between LaTeX, MS Word, and HTML but rather be able to author documents that target all of them at the same time.\nMake reproducible research and publications the norm rather than the exception. Reproducibility requires that the code and data required to create a manuscript are an integrated part of it. However, this isn‚Äôt often straightforward in practice‚ÄîQuarto aims to make it easier to adopt a reproducible workflow than not.\n\nQuarto is open source software licensed under the GNU GPL v2. We believe that it‚Äôs better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science."
