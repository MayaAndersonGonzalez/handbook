Working open is not only about sharing the end results, but about actively inviting people into the process. GitHub is an essential tool to do this, and anything we write is open source.\nGitHub was originally intended for code, but don‚Äôt let that scare you - we are here to help you along the way and get you the skills you need. We are using it for writing like this handbook too!"

    "text": "Terminology\n\nRepositories\nOn your computer, you may have folders for different projects. On GitHub, instead of folders, you have ‚Äúrepositories.‚Äù Each repository contains that project‚Äôs files. For example, the repository for this handbook contains this entire website.\nEach repository contains a history of all the changes. This is helpful because it allows us to always go back to older versions if things go horribly wrong.\nYou can watch, fork, and star a repository. Watching a repository is subscribing to its updates (you will receive notifications of ongoing discussions). Forking a repository means creating your own copy of it. Starring a repository saves it as a favorite (an important metric for popularity too).\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are the primary place for open questions. Each repository has a so-called ‚Äúissue tracker.‚Äù This is a great place to make suggestions and participate in discussions on how to change things.\nAnybody on GitHub can start an issue, so opening an issue does not mean it will be resolved. When opening an issue, it is important to communicate effectively and focus on making sure you provide all the relevant information to understand what needs to be resolved (communicate for the person reading it).\n\n\nPull Requests\nA repository goes through many changes - a pull request (PR) is a proposed change that is requested to be incorporated into the main version. It is good practice to only make changes using pull requests when a project hits the first complete version.\nWe maintain a ‚Äúminimal pull request‚Äù standard. This makes it easier to manage many changes over time, as the energy needed to understand one pull request remains minimal. For example, if you‚Äôre substantially editing this page in the handbook, you might realize you also found a typo in another page. A minimal pull request would mean you separate the edits for this page and the typo on the other page into two pull requests. It may also mean you split the edits on this page into multiple pull requests if they are unrelated (e.g., correcting typo‚Äôs and adding a whole new section)."
