Working open is not only about sharing the end results, but about actively inviting people into the process. GitHub is an essential tool to do this, and anything we write is open source.\nGitHub was originally intended for code, but don‚Äôt let that scare you - we are here to help you along the way and get you the skills you need. We are using it for writing like this handbook too!"

    "section": "Terminology",
    "text": "Terminology\n\nRepositories\nOn your computer, you may have folders for different projects. On GitHub, instead of folders, you have ‚Äúrepositories.‚Äù Each repository contains that project‚Äôs files. For example, the repository for this handbook contains this entire website.\nEach repository contains a history of all the changes. This is helpful because it allows us to always go back to older versions if things go horribly wrong.\nYou can watch, fork, and star a repository. Watching a repository is subscribing to its updates (you will receive notifications of ongoing discussions). Forking a repository means creating your own copy of it. Starring a repository saves it as a favorite (an important metric for popularity too).\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are the primary place for open questions. Each repository has a so-called ‚Äúissue tracker.‚Äù This is a great place to make suggestions and participate in discussions on how to change things.\nAnybody on GitHub can start an issue, so opening an issue does not mean it will be resolved. When opening an issue, it is important to communicate effectively and focus on making sure you provide all the relevant information to understand what needs to be resolved (communicate for the person reading it).\n\n\nPull Requests\nA repository goes through many changes - a pull request (PR) is a proposed change that is requested to be incorporated into the main version. It is good practice to only make changes using pull requests when a project hits the first complete version.\nWe maintain a ‚Äúminimal pull request‚Äù standard. This makes it easier to manage many changes over time, as the energy needed to understand one pull request remains minimal. For example, if you‚Äôre substantially editing this page in the handbook, you might realize you also found a typo in another page. A minimal pull request would mean you separate the edits for this page and the typo on the other page into two pull requests. It may also mean you split the edits on this page into multiple pull requests if they are unrelated (e.g., correcting typo‚Äôs and adding a whole new section)."

Everybody who is on Liberate Science‚Äôs payroll gets to participate in discussions leading up to the changes.\nWage scales are separated for employees and formal directors. Formal directors are registered in the Chamber of Commerce, carry additional obligations and responsibilities, and have different contracts. Directors receive 12 months‚Äô pay, whereas employees receive 12 months‚Äô pay plus an additional 2 (holiday money, prorated according to tenure and paid out in May + December).\n\nHoliday pay is prorated on the basis of employment during the cycles May-May and December-December. For example, if you started on September 1st, you get 4/12th holiday pay in December and 9/12th in May.\n\nEach person in the organization is scaled according to their tenure in years with Liberate Science. During your first year after your start date, you are in scale 1. If you have been with the organization for 5 years, you are in scale 5.

I did my PhD in statistics, and am happy to now be working on sustainable alternatives in research that make our lives easier.\nResearchEquals is one such project and I am thankful that you lot are making the time to join here!\n\n\nGoals [00:05 - 00:07]\n\nThe goal of the cohort is provide a safe learning environment around modular publishing. What is it? Why is it? How does it work?\nTogether we‚Äôll learn how to publish the research process instead of the results alone\nWe‚Äôre also here, together, to create connection and community, so we don‚Äôt have to go at it alone.\n\nCode of Conduct [00:07 - 00:10 - Vinodh Ilangovan]\nStructure [00:10 - 00:15]\n\nMon - Thu\nMeet in Zoom\nChat in Discord\nThere may be additional materials before the cohort calls for you to go through, which we‚Äôll always keep time effective.\nAt the end of the cohort, everybody who completed the course will receive a digital certificate.\n\nShort introductions [00:15 - 00:30 - Chris]\n\nGetting the hang of whiteboards\n\nWhere is everyone from\n\nIntroduce yourself\n\n~2min each\n\nWho are you\nResearch interest\nWhat‚Äôs your guilty pleasure\n\nOthers make sticky notes\n\nTo make an account on ResearchEquals if they haven‚Äôt already\nGetting the hang of Discord [00:30 - 00:35 - Chris]\n\nClosing\n\nOn Thursday, same time, we will discuss modules in-depth, and\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy and what are modules?\n\n\nWelcome\n\n[Icebreaker]\nRecap\n\nIn our first call, we got to know each other a bit.\nFor this call, you prepared by watching a short video on the idea of publishing the research process. You learned about selective publishing, and how altering predictions based on results may be a result from the article format.\nYou now know that research modules are comparable to research steps.\n\nToday‚Äôs goal: Understand single modules and what goes into a module.\n\nDo you feel like published research in your field showcases the way research is actually done?\n\nWhere could it improve?\n\nWhat research steps are often overlooked in your field?\nDemo ResearchEquals\nExercise\n\nThink about your most recent research project. What is the latest step you took? What are the outputs/files you created from this?\nCreate your own draft module\nGo through the module types - are there any steps you are already missing?\n\nReportback from exercise\n\nWhat‚Äôs your first impressions of research modules?\n\nRecap of today\n\nWe learned how to create our first module, and what has to be included for each module.\nWe also learned what optional information\n\nToday we learned about individual steps in the research process.\n\nNext time we‚Äôll talk more about how those steps combine into an entire research journey.\nFor the next call, take a few minutes to write down the steps involved in your research.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeconstructing your research\n\n\nWelcome [5min]\n\n[Icebreaker]\nRecap - we learned about singular modules last call\nToday we‚Äôll learn how all these modules tie together to create different research processes\n\nShareback: reflections on your own research journey [5min]\n\nWhat steps surprised you?\nWhat would you like your research journey to include, but currently do not?\nWhere do you think your research is different from fields?\n\nExercise 1: Match the research process to the study type [5 min]\nDiscussion: What‚Äôs the added value in sharing the research journey?
