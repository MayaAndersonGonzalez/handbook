We consider any gathering of people, at our request, an event. This also includes travel at our request.

## Rules

1. We run all our events virtually by default.
2. Local in-person events are permitted when a clear added value is documented.
3. Everywhere [we can go in 8 hours with public transport is considered local](https://www.chronotrains.com/en).
4. In-person events only happen with the consent of attendees.
5. Hybrid events are organized as virtual first.
6. The event policy applies to both internal and external events.
