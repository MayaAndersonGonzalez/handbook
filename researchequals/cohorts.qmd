    - Recap
        - In our first call, we got to know each other a bit.
        - For this call, you prepared by watching a short video on the idea of publishing the research process. You learned about selective publishing, and how altering predictions based on results may be a result from the article format.
        - You now know that research modules are comparable to research steps.
    - Today's goal: Understand single modules and what goes into a module.
- Do you feel like published research in your field showcases the way research is actually done?
    - Where could it improve?
- What research steps are often overlooked in your field?
- Demo ResearchEquals
- Exercise
    - [ ] Think about your most recent research project. What is the latest step you took? What are the outputs/files you created from this?
    - [ ] Create your own draft module
    - [ ] Go through the module types - are there any steps you are already missing?
- Reportback from exercise
    - What's your first impressions of research modules?
- Recap of today
    - We learned how to create our first module, and what has to be included for each module.
    - We also learned what optional information 
- Today we learned about individual steps in the research process. 
    - Next time we'll talk more about how those steps combine into an entire research journey. 
    - For the next call, take a few minutes to write down the steps involved in your research.
