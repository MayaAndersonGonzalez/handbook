This is our collective handbook, with the resources needed to create a shared understanding of how we work. 

Use the search button 🔍 in the top right corner to find what you need.

How we work is continuously evolving, so we encourage suggested edits! This also means reading up regularly to ensure you are aware of changes.

This handbook applies to both employees, contractors, volunteers, and otherwise. Some of it is descriptive (how we actually work), some of it is prescriptive (how we should work).
