How we work is continuously evolving, so we encourage suggested edits! This also means checking in here to ensure you are aware of the latest changes.

This handbook applies to both employees, contractors, volunteers, and otherwise. Some of it is descriptive (how we actually work) and some of it is prescriptive (how we should work).
